This notebook helps you visually inspect and test the anomaly detection model using images.

Key Things It Does:
--------------------
1. ✅ Loads your trained autoencoder model from disk.
2. 📐 Transforms input images to match model training size (128x128).
3. 🧠 Computes anomaly scores by comparing original vs. reconstructed images.
4. 🖼 Shows side-by-side visuals of original and reconstruction.
5. 🔍 Lets you select and test individual images interactively.
6. 📊 Scores a full directory and saves results to CSV for review.

How to Interpret:
--------------------
- Low Score (e.g. < 0.01): ✅ REAL / GENUINE
- High Score (e.g. > 0.015): ⚠️ SUSPECT / FAKE

You can now visually test different brands and samples, and also export analysis for reporting.
